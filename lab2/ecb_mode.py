In ECB mode, each message is divided into blocks, and each block is encrypted separately.
The disadvantage of this mode is that it is deterministic, meaning that the same plaintext
block will always produce the same ciphertext block. This means that patterns in the plaintext
will be visible in the ciphertext.
